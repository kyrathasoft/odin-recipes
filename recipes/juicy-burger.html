    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>No more dry, lackluster hamburgers. These are juicy, and spices can be easily added or changed to suit anyone's taste. If you find the meat mixture too mushy, just add more bread crumbs until it forms patties that hold their shape.</p>
    <p>This aptly named hamburger recipe uses evaporated milk, eggs, and bread crumbs to create incredibly juicy and flavorful hamburger patties that will rival your favorite burger joint.</p>
